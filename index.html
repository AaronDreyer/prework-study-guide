        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html - This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened</li>
          <li>html opening tag - which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document</li>
          <li>lang="en" - which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English)</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage</li>
          <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
          <li>The charset element sets our character encoding</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>The src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples</li>
          <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook</li>
          <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case</li>
          <li>All types except Object define immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language. We refer to values of these types as primitive values</li>
          <li>String - This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks</li>
          <li>Number - This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them</li>
          <li>Boolean - This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal</li>
          <li>Array - This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference</li>
          <li>Object - This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables)</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code</li>
          <li>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types</li>
          <li>JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
          <li>function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run</li>

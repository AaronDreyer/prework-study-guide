# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a prework study guide created using my computer's terminal, github, visual studio code, and the bootcamp's modules. This helps students learn the basics of creating an application (which can be accessed as a reference later), using different coding languages (HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT), and operating the github website.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This application allows students to review over the materials listed in the prework modules for the bootcamp. This includes operation of the github in the command line of a computer's terminal, simple skeleton of a HTML program, styling using CSS elements, and functionality using Javascript. Each topic is listed in the application with notes pertaining to it. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
